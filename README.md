# Riemannian coordinate descent algorithms on matrix manifolds

This repo contains matlab implementation for the paper "Riemannian coordinate descent algorithms on matrix manifolds". The code is based on ManOpt, a Matlab package for Riemannian optimization. To run the code, first download the ManOpt from https://github.com/NicolasBoumal/manopt, and then run `run_me_first.m` to add the folders to the current path.
